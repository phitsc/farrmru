===============================================================================

Description
=====================
MruCmd is a command line tool to list your most recently used files. It can be used in conjunction with donationcoder's LaunchBarCommander to display your most recently used files within a LaunchBarCommander submenu.


Usage
=====================
MruCmd supports just the same modifier keywords as the FarrMostRecentlyUsed plugin, so make sure to read the readme.txt containing all the details. To use MruCmd you pass the commands and keywords you would enter into the FARR input search window (when using the FarrMRU plugin) as arguments to MruCmd.exe.

There are two things to note:
1. While the FarrMRU plugin requires you to start keywords with a +, you can also start them with a - for MruCmd
2. MruCmd supports two additional keywords:
   -lbcseparate : will separate your most recently used files with text header separators
   -lbcgroup    : will group your most recently used files in submenus
   
 
Examples
=====================

1. List all your most recently used files and group them in submenus:

   MruCmd.exe mrua -lbcgroup


2. List all your recently used Office and PDF files and separate them with headers:

   MruCmd.exe mrup -office3 -office7 -foxit -lbcseparate


3. List all your recently used Visual Studio 2008 files with farr in their file names:

   MruCmd.exe mrup -msvc9 farr


4. List all files from My Recent Documents sorted alphabetically:

   MruCmd.exe mrum -byname

   
5. List all your recently used .h and .cpp files

   MruCmd.exe mrua -.h -.cpp
